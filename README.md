# üì∫ Streaming Platform

A full-stack, scalable video streaming platform enabling users to upload, transcode, and stream videos via adaptive bitrate streaming (HLS). The platform is modularized into microservices and supports secure upload (OAuth 2.0), Kafka-based communication, and OpenSearch for metadata indexing and retrieval.

## üì¶ Services Breakdown

### 1. Upload Service

* Receives video uploads via multipart or chunked approach
* Streams to S3 using AWS SDK
* Stores metadata (title, author, description, URL) in PostgreSQL (via Prisma)
* Publishes Kafka message (`filename`) to `transcode` topic

### 2. Transcoder Service

* Listens to Kafka `transcode` topic
* Downloads video from S3
* Transcodes into multiple HLS formats using `ffmpeg`
* Uploads `.m3u8` playlist and `.ts` segments to S3

### 3. Watch Service

* Serves signed URLs for secure video playback
* Lists all uploaded videos (fetched from Postgres via Prisma)
* Supports HLS streaming via S3 pre-signed links

### 4. Client (Next.js)

* Login with Google (NextAuth OAuth 2.0)
* Upload form with title, author, description
* Lists all uploaded videos in a grid with ReactPlayer
* Streams YouTube and HLS URLs
* Authenticated access only for upload

### 5. Search Service

* Pushes video metadata to OpenSearch after upload
* Allows full-text search using OpenSearch queries
* Integrates fuzzy match, phrase match, and boolean search

---

## üîê Authentication

* Google OAuth2 integration using `next-auth`
* Upload page is protected (only visible after login)
* Session context maintained across frontend

---

## üì§ Upload Mechanisms

* ‚úÖ Direct upload to backend ‚Üí S3
* ‚úÖ Chunked upload (sequential & parallel)
* ‚úÖ Multipart upload via AWS S3 SDK
* ‚úÖ Metadata stored in DB & indexed in OpenSearch

---

## üì∫ Streaming Protocols

* üé• YouTube URL streaming (via `react-player`)
* üéû S3 video URL streaming with signed URLs
* üõÅ HLS streaming (m3u8 & ts files) with adaptive bitrate support
* üí° DASH support (experimental, code included)

---

## üîç Search Capabilities

* OpenSearch used for indexing:

  * title, author, description, videoUrl
* Supports:

  * Match queries
  * Fuzzy matching
  * Simple query strings
  * Bool queries

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js 18+
* PostgreSQL & Prisma setup
* AWS S3 Bucket (with appropriate CORS & IAM roles)
* Aiven Kafka & OpenSearch accounts

### Environment Variables

```env
# Upload & Watch Services
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
AWS_BUCKET=bucket_name
AWS_REGION=ap-south-1

# Auth

## üß™ Testing APIs

* Upload endpoint: `POST /upload`
* Watch endpoint: `GET /watch?key=video.mp4`
* Search endpoint: `GET /search?q=title`
* Kafka test route: `POST /publish` (send `filename`)

Use Postman to test file uploads and signed URL retrieval.

---

## üé• Sample Flow

1. Login with Google ‚Üí Upload Video
2. Upload Service saves metadata, pushes Kafka message
3. Transcoder downloads from S3, encodes HLS, re-uploads to S3
4. Watch Service provides signed `.m3u8` URL
5. Client fetches signed URL and streams via `HLS.js`

---

## üìä Future Scope

* ElasticSearch Dashboard with Kibana (via OpenSearch)
* Real-time notifications via WebSockets
* Video analytics (views, watch time)
* Transcoding status monitor
* Lambda functions for async workflows
